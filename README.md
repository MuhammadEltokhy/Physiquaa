Hi, I'm Physiquaa. 
Surely you was studying physics in ur school, but most of your heart and brain hated it ðŸ˜¢,
even sometimes skipping its sessions! Maybe u r, maybe u not, maybe u wanted to start in it. 
The problem is that u don't know where and how to start. Don't worry, I'm here to save u. 
Physiquaa made u a good guide to start in learning the high school physics, 
and even be able to get at least bronze medal in IPhO ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ (haha just kidding ðŸ˜…, but u can do that on your own). 
What r u waiting for to start physics?
